# Transport Monitor

Effective design, engineering, delivery of Ethereum, IPFS and Web3 tools aided solution for vehicles and citizens to make roads safer and better for everyone using predictive analytics and automation.

Transport Monitor is an analytics and incident management platform for citizens, police officers, drivers to report and manage incidents, detect and prevent accidents on web, mobile in a secure and simplified manner using Ethereum, IPFS and Web3 tools aided solution.  Features:

360 degrees access: Command and control centers can manage the complete lifecycle of incident reporting, overall status, enable early stage prevention of accidents and road safety counseling, management of workforce at the incident site.

Incident Dashboard: Manage and track your incidents as a citizen along with sharing reviews and comments. Incident reporting, severity analytics and sentiment analysis using social media data for early stage detection and prevention of incidents.

Real Time Alerts and Live Streaming: Real time alerts and live streaming for incident verification and quick action.

Real Time Analytics: Analytics of the incidents with sentiment analysis, live incident reporting. road safety eco-system. Health summary of the police staff, scheduling the staff. Reducing misinformation.

Community Benefits:

Ministry of Road and Transportation: Endeavor to change the car accident scenario by use of car technology to make driving safer and monitored for drivers, authorities, as well as other 3rd parties. With a mix of hardware and software, we provide intelligent feedback about drive quality and help analyze past incidents, as well as predict future incidents.

Citizens and Cab aggregators: Reduction in the number of road accidents.

Insurance Companies: Aggregated/ anonymized driving data, incident data will be helpful to car insurance companies.

OEMs and Dealerships: Vehicle diagnostics and in-car service consumption will be helpful for OEMs and Dealerships.

Smart Cities Policy Makers/ Government: Real time traffic flow, incident alert, parking data will be enable safer roads.

Advertisers: Customers/driver demographics are available.

Fleet customers: fleet performance.

Urbit Integration

1. Integration of webrtc protocol to Urbit for video conferencing and communication at the incident spot: We are extending the WebRTC integration for Urbit for just in time video communication about the incidents reported by citizens and coordinated by police officer, dispatcher, admin and government officials at the command and control center. Please visit: https://github.com/seetadev/Security22X/tree/main/roadincidentmanagement/urbit-webrtc

2. Urbit Incident Survey Chatbot: We are using Urbit chatbot framework (poll example) within our solution so that the incident surveys could be integrated within the chat application specific to discussions on road incidents where there is dispute on its cause or impact. Please visit: https://github.com/seetadev/Security22X/tree/main/roadincidentmanagement/urbit-incident-survey

3. Urbit Incident Notes: We are using Urbit based integration of TodoMVC example for implementing incident and monitoring notes maintained by transport administrators. Please visit: https://github.com/seetadev/Security22X/tree/main/roadincidentmanagement/urbit-monitoring-notes

IPFS: We are using IPFS for storing a variety of offchain data like incident snapshots, alarm metadata and object types at the time of incident. Please find the demo video at  (demo_screen capture.mov under demo directory at https://drive.google.com/drive/u/3/folders/1wPLgUHDg1C4-TT8tPtQeVw_UyXeVA_Hc and source code link at https://github.com/seetadev/Security22X/tree/main/NFT.Storage-incidents-alarm). We are storing Alarm metadata using IPFS. Also, Saving/deleting alarm metadata and image to/from IPFS. We are also storing the hash returned from IPFS to Ethereum test network. Further we are using IPFS for: Video analytics configuration using IPFS; Camera Management: Add/edit/delete cameras with integration with oss streaming, IPFS; Live streaming with Object Detection Video Analytics, and IPFS for snapshots.

Our IPFS powered solution will enable better coordination, enable road safety ecosystem to be more effective, proactive, help in early prediction and prevention of incidents. Please find the pitch deck and demo at https://drive.google.com/drive/u/3/folders/1wPLgUHDg1C4-TT8tPtQeVw_UyXeVA_Hc



# How it works:

Camera Management: Add/edit/delete cameras with integration to Urbit for webrtc solution for video conferencing and communication at the incident spot and IPFS for snapshots of road incidents.

Object Detection using OSS AI library based solution.

Video analytics configuration using IPFS, security and data retrieval.

Video conferencing using webrtc integration on Urbit and Live streaming with Object Detection Video Analytics, IPFS for snapshots. 

Alarm storage using Ethereum. Save/delete alarm metadata and image to/from IPFS. Store the hash returned from IPFS to Ethereum test network using IPFS. Provide links to alarms and blockchain transaction details.

Alarm Viewer: Add alarms with a single touch. Open the Alarm Settings menu from the home page. Add an alarm, set the wallpaper or choose an alarm tone. You can also delete an existing alarm.
