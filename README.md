# Security ICM

Technical solution for security and monitoring road incidents using Ethereum, IPFS, NFT.Storage and OSS AI; enable early detection and prevention of accidents.

Goal: Ensure effective design, engineering and delivery of a decentralized solution to make roads safer and better using using Ethereum, IPFS, NFT.Storage and OSS AI.

Our solution offers an Artificial Intelligence-based object detection system that utilizes ethereum blockchain solutions powered by NFT.Storage for sorting information obtained from a variety of road junctions, cameras deployed at monitoring spots.

NFT.Storage: We are using NFT.Storage for storing a variety of offchain data like incident snapshots, alarm metadata and object types at the time of incident. Please find the demo video at  (demo.mov and demo.mp4 under demo directory at https://drive.google.com/drive/u/3/folders/1xYwivgACmcjNkhMEJA69DsKisXUIEIde and source code link at https://github.com/seetadev/Security22X/tree/main/NFT.Storage-incidents-alarm). We are storing Alarm metadata using NFT.Storage. Also, Saving/deleting alarm metadata and image to/from IPFS using NFT.Storage. We are also storing the hash returned from IPFS to Ethereum test network using NFT.Storage. Further we are using NFT.Storage for: Video analytics configuration using NFT.Storage; Camera Management: Add/edit/delete cameras with integration with oss streaming, NFT.Storage; Live streaming with Object Detection Video Analytics, and NFT.Storage for snapshots.

Our NFT.storage powered solution will enable better coordination, enable road safety ecosystem to be more effective, proactive, help in early prediction and prevention of incidents. Please find the pitch deck and demo at https://drive.google.com/drive/u/3/folders/1xYwivgACmcjNkhMEJA69DsKisXUIEIde

How it works:

Camera Management: Add/edit/delete cameras with integration to NFT.Storage for snapshots of road incidents.

Object Detection using OSS AI library based solution.

Video analytics configuration using NFT.Storage, security and data retrieval.

Live streaming with Object Detection Video Analytics, NFT.Storage for snapshots.

Alarm storage using Ethereum. Save/delete alarm metadata and image to/from IPFS using NFT.Storage. Store the hash returned from IPFS to Ethereum test network using NFT.Storage. Provide links to alarms and blockchain transaction details.

Alarm Viewer: Add alarms with a single touch. Open the Alarm Settings menu from the home page. Add an alarm, set the wallpaper or choose an alarm tone. You can also delete an existing alarm.
