# Transport Monitor

Technical solution for security and monitoring road incidents using Polkadot, Urbit, Ethereum, IPFS and OSS AI models; enable early detection and prevention of accidents.

Goal: Ensure effective design, engineering and delivery of a decentralized solution to make roads safer and better using Polkadot, Urbit, Ethereum, IPFS and OSS AI.

Our solution offers an Artificial Intelligence-based object detection system that utilizes Polkadot, Urbit and ethereum blockchain solutions powered by IPFS storage for sorting information obtained from a variety of road junctions, cameras deployed at monitoring spots.


# Beneficiaries

Smart Cities: Real-time traffic flow, incident alert, parking

Insurance Companies: Aggregated, anonymized driving data, incident data

Police Officers, dispatchers, drivers, pedestrians, passengers, civic bodies

Advertisers: Customer demographics



Urbit Integration

1. Integration of webrtc protocol to Urbit for video conferencing and communication at the incident spot: We are extending the WebRTC integration for Urbit for just in time video communication about the incidents reported by citizens and coordinated by police officer, dispatcher, admin and government officials at the command and control center. Please visit: https://github.com/seetadev/Security22X/tree/main/roadincidentmanagement/urbit-webrtc

2. Urbit Incident Survey Chatbot: We are using Urbit chatbot framework (poll example) within our solution so that the incident surveys could be integrated within the chat application specific to discussions on road incidents where there is dispute on its cause or impact. Please visit: https://github.com/seetadev/Security22X/tree/main/roadincidentmanagement/urbit-incident-survey

3. Urbit Incident Notes: We are using Urbit based integration of TodoMVC example for implementing incident and monitoring notes maintained by transport administrators. Please visit: https://github.com/seetadev/Security22X/tree/main/roadincidentmanagement/urbit-monitoring-notes

IPFS: We are using IPFS for storing a variety of offchain data like incident snapshots, alarm metadata and object types at the time of incident. Please find the demo video at  (demo_screen capture.mov under demo directory at https://drive.google.com/drive/u/3/folders/1wPLgUHDg1C4-TT8tPtQeVw_UyXeVA_Hc and source code link at https://github.com/seetadev/Security22X/tree/main/NFT.Storage-incidents-alarm). We are storing Alarm metadata using IPFS. Also, Saving/deleting alarm metadata and image to/from IPFS. We are also storing the hash returned from IPFS to Ethereum test network. Further we are using IPFS for: Video analytics configuration using IPFS; Camera Management: Add/edit/delete cameras with integration with oss streaming, IPFS; Live streaming with Object Detection Video Analytics, and IPFS for snapshots.

Our IPFS powered solution will enable better coordination, enable road safety ecosystem to be more effective, proactive, help in early prediction and prevention of incidents. Please find the pitch deck and demo at https://drive.google.com/drive/u/3/folders/1wPLgUHDg1C4-TT8tPtQeVw_UyXeVA_Hc

# How it works:

Camera Management: Add/edit/delete cameras with integration to Urbit for webrtc solution for video conferencing and communication at the incident spot and IPFS for snapshots of road incidents.

Object Detection using OSS AI library based solution.

Video analytics configuration using IPFS, security and data retrieval.

Video conferencing using webrtc integration on Urbit and Live streaming with Object Detection Video Analytics, IPFS for snapshots. 

Alarm storage using Ethereum. Save/delete alarm metadata and image to/from IPFS. Store the hash returned from IPFS to Ethereum test network using IPFS. Provide links to alarms and blockchain transaction details.

Alarm Viewer: Add alarms with a single touch. Open the Alarm Settings menu from the home page. Add an alarm, set the wallpaper or choose an alarm tone. You can also delete an existing alarm.
