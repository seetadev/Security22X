Ensure effective design, engineering and delivery of decentralized storage and OSS AI to make roads safer and better.

Our solution offers an Artificial Intelligence-based object detection system that utilizes ethereum blockchain solutions powered by NFT.Storage for sorting information obtained from a variety of road junctions, cameras deployed at monitoring spots.

NFT.Storage: We are using NFT.Storage for storing a variety of offchain data like incident snapshots, alarm metadata and object types at the time of incident. Please find the video at  (demo.mov file). We are storing Alarm metadata using NFT.Storage. Also, Saving/deleting alarm metadata and image to/from IPFS using NFT.Storage. We are also storing the hash returned from IPFS to Ethereum test network using NFT.Storage. Further we are using NFT.Storage for: Video analytics configuration using NFT.Storage; Camera Management: Add/edit/delete cameras with integration with oss streaming, NFT.Storage; Live streaming with Object Detection Video Analytics using Livepeer for streaming, and NFT.Storage for snapshots.

Our NFT.storage powered solution will enable better coordination, enable road safety ecosystem to be more effective, proactive, help in early prediction and prevention of incidents. Please find the pitch deck and demo at https://drive.google.com/drive/u/3/folders/1xYwivgACmcjNkhMEJA69DsKisXUIEIde
