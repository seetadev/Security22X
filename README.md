Video conferencing using webrtc integration on Urbit and Live streaming with Object Detection Video Analytics, IPFS for snapshots. 

Alarm storage using Ethereum. Save/delete alarm metadata and image to/from IPFS. Store the hash returned from IPFS to Ethereum test network using IPFS. Provide links to alarms and blockchain transaction details.

Alarm Viewer: Add alarms with a single touch. Open the Alarm Settings menu from the home page. Add an alarm, set the wallpaper or choose an alarm tone. You can also delete an existing alarm. 

# EthforAll hackathon using Web3 eco-system tooling:

1. FVM:  We are utilizing FVM to develop and use composable blocks and ensure effective design, engineering and delivery of a decentralized solution for road safety, monitoring and incident management using Ethereum & Filecoin eco-system tools:

- Decentralized NFT-based voting system for contract work for service & maintenance providers and companies and Ministry of Transportation. DAOs can issue NFTs to wallets based on service and maintenance performance and work completed, and the holders of these NFTs can create proposals and vote on other proposals whilst they have the NFTs of that contract work. Votes are uploaded to IPFS with the most recent vote linking to one before. 

- Creating a Transport NFT on the FVM for NFC tags of vehicle service and repair providers & vehicles to improve road incident management, decentralized NFT-based voting system for contract work by service providers, Votes are uploaded to IPFS with the most recent vote linking to one before.

2. SuperFluid + UMA: We are using Superfluid as a token streaming protocol that lets vehicle users and consumers create streams of tokens fluidly between addresses. This will enable effective incentivization, management and communication setup for service/repair organizations utilized in Operations and Maintenance. We are extending Superfluid’s streaming tokens with UMA’s KPI Options: Perpetual Conditional Rewards (PCR) tokens that combine Superfluid’s programmable cashflows with UMA’s KPI option concepts. Service Users and administrators would receive immediate benefits and feedback based on how that KPI was doing. Immediate feedback like this would be highly motivating. 

3. Polywrap with Axelar: We are using Polywrap with Axelar for communication between Polygon blockchain and Fantom destination chain: 
- Government organizations can send aUSDC from Polygon source-chain to Fantom destination-chain and distribute it equally among all accounts specified for subsidy or reimbursement using call contract with token.
- Cross chain lending platform: We can supply collateral and borrow tokens from a satellite chain to a fork of Ethereum's mainnet using existing Compound Protocol.
- Cross chain dapp development: We are extending the starter kit to develop cross chain dapps using Polywrap, Axelar.

4. Chainlink: E-Challan (Transport Receipt) Bill Generation: We are utilizing Chainlink Mix to work with Chainlink smart contracts. The bill script will deploy a smart contract to goerli and get a Random number via Chainlink VRF, which can used to identify a unique transaction/order number for the receipt or bill.

- We are extending and adapting the Chainlink project "Link My Ride" to develop a decentralized first aid and ambulance platform by using Chainlink External Adapter to connect a Tesla Vehicle API to a Chainlink oracle for a peer-to-peer vehicle rental app. We wish to use it for Maruti Vehicle API and Hyundai Vehicle API too. 

- Parametric Insurance Solution in public transportation especially for project finance. We are utilizing an existing example at chainlink github repo to develop an insurance solution for public transportation.


5. Polygon: We are utilizing ZoraModuleManager, and ZoraProtocolFeeSettings in our our dapp and deploying it on Polygon after registering the Zora market module. We are developing a crowdsourcing marketplace using Zora's auction house template for enabling sharing of government assets like prepaid card, meter details information, meter license management and quarterly pollution check and control. We are using the zora starter kit to access ZORA API, Creator Toolkit, and Marketplace Hyperstructure. Zora's Auction House template is being utilized for NFT marketplace of alarm clock wallpapers and background ringtones purchase and auction.


6. Livepeer: We are using Livepeer with Aptos as the key infrastructure provider for online video streaming of critical road incidents. We are using Livepeer with Aptos at: Live streaming with Object Detection Video Analytics using Livepeer for streaming; Camera Management: Add/edit/delete cameras with integration with Livepeer.
Functions: Live streaming with Object Detection Video Analytics using Livepeer for streaming; Camera Management: Add/edit/delete cameras with integration with Livepeer.
We are using Livepeer ondemand service to enable effective management and communication setup for transport services utilized in Operations and Maintenance across multiple regions.  Please visit Livepeer integration with Aptos and also minting Livepeer Video NFT at Aptos.


7. Consensys's Infura and Metamask tools with Optimism NFT marketplace and Scalability of Decentralized Public Goods, Mobility Network Enablement: Optimism NFT marketplace for vehicle's spare parts and also for early-stage detection and prevention of incidents using Infura; NFC tags of vehicles for enabling sharing of government assets and service/repair of vital assets. Improving Data Transparency in Incident Management Using Ethereum Blockchain, Infura, Metamask and Optimism NFT marketplace. Optimism NFT marketplace for NFC tags of vehicles for enabling sharing of government assets and service/repair of vital assets. We are also using Optimism to enable scaling of the decentralized public goods mobility network and effective management and communication setup for services utilized in Operations and Maintenance across multiple regions.

8. Mantle: We are using Mantle to develop a platform where users can issue, manage and transfer credits of ratings earned for vehicle owners and their respective vehicles via pollution checks,  green fuel adoption in vehicles:
User creation procedure; 
User identification with NFC tags; 
Create credits of ratings earned via pollution checks, green fuel  assets; 
Issue green credits for vehicles via pollution checks; 
List your green credits per vehicle; 
Handle multiple vehicles.
 
9. Connext: Decentralized NFT-based voting system for RFPs and donations on L2 and communication using Connext-
- DAOs or Organisations create a RFP on the app.
- Users can join a RFP by minting an NFT of that RFP
- Users that have a certain RFP's NFT are eligible to create proposals and vote on them.
- Voting is gasless and the vote is stored on IPFS 
 
 
10. Arcana: We are extending the Arcana demo app for utilizing the user security and authentication, storage methods with capabilities pluggable and extendable to 5 different personas: Driver, Police, Citizen, Dispatcher, Admin. Arcana enables 360 degrees access of the incidents to the action/ administration team. They can manage the complete lifecycle of incident reporting, overall status, traffic monitoring, managing police teams. They can also use the solution for effective user security of staff members and provide road safety counselling. 



# Pre-hackathon developments at the github repository
Urbit Integration

IPFS: We are using IPFS for storing a variety of offchain data like incident snapshots, alarm metadata and object types at the time of incident. Please find the demo video at  (demo_screen capture.mov under demo directory at https://drive.google.com/drive/u/3/folders/1wPLgUHDg1C4-TT8tPtQeVw_UyXeVA_Hc and source code link at https://github.com/seetadev/Security22X/tree/main/NFT.Storage-incidents-alarm). We are storing Alarm metadata using IPFS. Also, Saving/deleting alarm metadata and image to/from IPFS. We are also storing the hash returned from IPFS to Ethereum test network. Further we are using IPFS for: Video analytics configuration using IPFS; Camera Management: Add/edit/delete cameras with integration with oss streaming, IPFS; Live streaming with Object Detection Video Analytics, and IPFS for snapshots.

Our IPFS powered solution will enable better coordination, enable road safety ecosystem to be more effective, proactive, help in early prediction and prevention of incidents. Please find the pitch deck and demo at https://drive.google.com/drive/u/3/folders/1wPLgUHDg1C4-TT8tPtQeVw_UyXeVA_Hc
