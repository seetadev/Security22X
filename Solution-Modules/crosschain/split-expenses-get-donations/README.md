We are utilizing Connext for developing the feature of splitting road management expenses and get support from government, private and civil society bodies. Connext enables us to develop the communication across the chains. Using xDonation.sol allows anyone to donate funds, regardless of what chain they are on. Donors send funds to the contract, and at any point an approved sweeper can call sweep which will swap into the donation asset and send the funds to the specified address and chain. We wish to utilize Connext with L2 layer for developing smart contract for setting parameters at deployment and handling payments from every listed user, connext for communication across chains; Balancing and simplifying settlements among members; Chainlink oracles for price feeds; Exchanging tokens.

We are extending the xdonations dapp for developing the above features.
