# Polywrap with Axelar 

We are using Polywrap with Axelar for communication between Polygon blockchain and Fantom destination chain: 
- Government organizations can send aUSDC from Polygon source-chain to Fantom destination-chain and distribute it equally among all accounts specified for subsidy or reimbursement using call contract with token.
- Cross chain lending platform: We can supply collateral and borrow tokens from a satellite chain to a fork of Ethereum's mainnet using existing Compound Protocol.
- Cross chain dapp development: We are extending the starter kit to develop cross chain dapps using Polywrap, Axelar.

We are extending the example for Avalanche and Polygon cross chain communication using Axelar with Polywrap: https://github.com/ConsiderItDone/axelar-demo-app
Our goal is to develop cross chain interoperability in communication, payments, analytics with Axelar using Polywrap. 

Benefits for Ministry of Road and Transportation: Endeavor to change the scenario by use of cross chain interoperability in communication with Axelar and Polywrap to make driving safer and monitored for drivers, authorities, 3rd parties.
