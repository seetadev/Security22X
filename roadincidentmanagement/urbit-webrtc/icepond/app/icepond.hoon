:: Architecture
:: Icepond is an agent for advertising and discovering ICE servers.
:: There are two types of ICE servers: STUN and TURN. Icepond is
:: agnostic about server type, but its architecture is intended to
:: facilitate ephemeral adverisement and discovery necessary for e.g.
:: time-limited and credentialed access to a TURN server
::
:: Icepond listens for watches on the /ice-servers/[rqid] path, where
:: rqid is a randomly generated identifier (e.g. 
:: `(scot %uv (sham our.bowl eny.bowl))`
::
:: On receiving a watch, it evaluates a fetcher config stored in its
:: state. This can be set by poking icepond with the
:: `%set-fetcher-config` mark and a vase of a `fetcher-config`
::
:: The result is icepond itself establishing watches and running
:: threads. Any servers it acquires from these watches or threads
:: are passed to the subscriber as facts. Once all watches which
:: were established for a request fail or are kicked, the requester
:: itself is kicked to signal that no more server advertisements are
:: forthcoming
